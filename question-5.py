# Task (Calculate the angle)
# Imagine a right angled triangle with sides AB, AC and BC
# M is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AC, task it find the angle MBC in degress
# Perform the following actions:
#   - First input is the length of side AB 
#   - Second input it the length of side BC
#   - Calculate the angle MBC
#   - Use {chr(176)} to print the degree sign

# Input Format => AB and BC is float
# Constrains
#   - 0 < AB <= 100
#   - 0 < BC <= 100
